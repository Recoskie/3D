this time i use super fast rotation that uses no float pointing except for 4 points per rotation

the rest is visable over half wich no longer have to be calculated just looped when legths shink

thay no longer nead to be calculated do not do work in the graphics then do graphics by drawing outputed pionts

less function calling increses spead no more graphic functions beaing called super fast 3D emulation without

the 3D graphics card do not draw out of bounds of drawing area and do not calculate out of bounds pionts

skip them small draw area extreamly fast 3D over 500 by 500 drawing area only about 20 to 80 calculation cuze transformation

even in complete 3D world super spead even run on older computers even windows 95 with 4.8 mghz processor
