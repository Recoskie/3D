now instead of thinking of it as lines now think of it as 4 corners and we shrink the x lengths to the

bottom 2 corners gives us the decresment or incresment of the next lines

and the first y distance to the left over the y distance to the right gives us the changes in each y

distance per line

uses a toltal of 4 3D piont calculations of exessive float pointing and multipalcation

wich now is deacesed by milions of calculations the rest is just add as sloping to each point
