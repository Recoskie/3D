is this new i dont know but i discovered somthing that can be put into mathimatic terms
for compersion the output should be a 1 or 0 what simbol shall it use i dont know

for example divishion finds how meny times the number fits now i only want how meny times it fits
without the float point numbers wich every calculator contains both int anf float operations
which int is created for the float point circut to run any whays the calculator may not have a int button
but siyntific do

like 5/3=1.666666 if we use int on it it should look like int(1.66666666)=1 or int(9.217217217)=9

i will not repetively use int in my formula since all numbers that you calculate in formula should all be int

type

now if i compear is 7 eqaule to 8 7/8=0 no because it does not fit one time wich is mathimaticly expressed

will 7 eqaul 7 7/7=1 yes it fits but there is one problem with the compersion what if it fits 2 times

7/14=2 then i have a problem the compersion would be rong

if its biger it must eqaul 0 2-1=1 1/2=0.5 4/5=0.8 since the number is biger and the devide into number will be smaler
resaults into a fraction in float a float point number in a integer it resaults into 0 now what if the input is a value of 1

1-1=0 then 0/1=0 still the problem remains but if it fits one time im at the center point of the number if i subtract 2

instead of 1 1-2=-1 -1/1=-1 i get the opaset number of 1 any number biger then 1 will resault into 0

2-2=0 0/2=0

4-2=2 2/4=0

because we will divide into a smaller number and 2 works perfect as a center point if its equal to 1 because of subtraction

output is -1 all other values are 0 how can i fix this by multiplying by -1 when 2 nagatives multiply output flips to posative

-1*-1=1 worked then if i write the full compersion formula

a=90
b=80

o=(((a/b)-2)/(a/b))*-1

"a" and "b" are the tow numbers being compered now formulas that nead alital bit of compersion can be acomplised by
Mathimatics

now imagin you only want to subtract 90 when the input is 180 with this function you can do this

myFunction(180,180)=1

now imagine what 1 can do

0*90=0

1*90=90

so now if it is eqaul our compersion amount is used if not the calculation is not done wich can be used as a simbol on paper
with a number infront of it with what it compears to

so

a=180

b=myFunction(180,a)*90

a=a-b;

where the subtraction naver hapens if its not 180 an entier compersion can be done fully with matimatics

even less than grater than and when you multiply by the compeared amount you get the output

now imagine this you have an entier set of calculations donw with compicated math then you have the output

and only uses those calculations at a spucific calculation then affter the output multiply it by this formula

i created (((a/b)-2)/(a/b))*-1 and there you go math is only logical compersion any whays base on logic

every bit of mater in this world can be compered with the enargy of another peace of mater or particles and atoms

to resoult what would happen and what thay resenate at to the change to resoult the color thay change to and disply

it on the screan of a computer monitor and to see what re action it has to other particles or atom affter wich is the entiyer

world wich if done corectly it may be posable to emulate our entiyer world if a powerfull enught muchine whas built

this is what makes the computer named after calculating muchine to be able to do so much when everything can be cpmeared

of how much and how much change which 3D graphics is entiyerly mathimaticle of wich points are most visible

by multiplying betwean 1 and 0 and -1 wich is close to the same as my compear function wich is sine cosine but thay are based

off the natrule shape of particles and what you do is set them on points of where thay are in the circle and then you change

the position of the circle seaing all points of a 3D shape called the x y z thory which is competly mathimatical

you can use mathimatics to put yow sounds together you can use matimatics to put tow voltages together

you can use mathimatics to put 2 particles together to calculate there spin from the enargy size though there enargy of magnatizim

you can even calculate the color thay will make
